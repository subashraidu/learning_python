Project: Number Guessing Game

Objective: The program will randomly select a number between 1 and 100, and the player will try to guess it. The program will give hints if the guess is too high or too low, and it will keep track of the number of attempts.

Steps to Build the Game

    Import Required Modules
        Use the random module to generate a random number.

    Define the Main Game Function
        Create a function that will handle the game logic.

    Get User Input
        Prompt the user to guess the number.

    Check the Guess
        Compare the guess to the randomly generated number and give feedback.

    Loop Until the Guess is Correct
        Keep asking the user for guesses until they get it right.

    Count Attempts
        Keep track of how many attempts the player made.
